 I'm going to show you a picture. I want you to look at the picture. I want you to tell me everything that you see happening in the picture. Just tell me everything that you see going on. Now, there's the picture. Look down here Mr. Toothi. See, part of the old kitchen. Is that old kitchen in residence? A lady, a mother, a kitchen. And her kitchen. And some wood. And some bows. And some here. Is another one in there sharing that? Play you here forever. Okay. There it is. Have you tried? Hard of that. I think they started to play after Christmas. Yes, you were telling me about that. It's a big trivial pursuit. Just tell me, do you see anything else happening in this picture here? What else do you see happening? What's going on there? Well, it looks like. I had to say this is. That's a good thing. Say it outside. One body, one body, the one body, the one body. The one that I've beaten me by. My wife has beaten me by. Oh no, this. What's happening over here, Mr. Toothi? That's like for you. Let's say, or some machine here. Oh, that's a son to my school, maybe? Or something? That's it, Mr. There. What's going on here? Well, it's just as though they. Getting ready to go to school or they're just coming home from school. Okay. Or what's happening here? Right there is. Same as back there except for down here in the bottom, I think. Uh. That's a little. Okay.
