 Let me see going on in a picture. Okay, the kid on the bench who's got his hand in the cookie joint is falling off. The sister once won. His mother is standing in a puddle of water because she didn't turn off the faucet. When she's trying to dry a dish, she ought to dry her feet instead. The windmill was open. The water sink is overflowing. It's obviously summer because the window, as I said, was open. Suppose they leave some trees. Anything else that wants to pick up? You just know anything you can come in. The kid's going to fall off. It's pretty cute. The lid is off the cookie jar. He's got one in his hand. Handing it to a sister. He's sneaking another one. I'm sneaking. The water is still running in the sink. And splashing on the floor.
