 Tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Tell me everything that's happening there. Young boy is after the cooking jar. He has a cooking jar open. He's reaching for one from south. He's handing one down to his sister. The three-legged stove is coming down with him. They're nicely dressed kids, but the boy needs a socks pulled up. That's all I see there. Mother, I presume it's mother is at the sink. The water is running over out of the sink. She's drying a dish. She's looking out the window. There are two cups and a dish. I presume that's a dish that her already dry, I guess, and sitting on the side of the sink. Nicely grown. Nice curtains pulled back. That's apparently somewhere outside because the windows open or it looks like shrubs are growing. You can see a window in the other part of the house. I presume that's still their house. There's a driveway bordered with grass. There's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage. I see cabinets around the kitchen. Other cabinets. That's about it.
