 Okay, here's the picture. Girl and boy, and a stool, cookies, cookies to our open closet. Okay. Curtain. What's going on in the picture? What kind of action is there? On the long-coage reaching for the cookies and falling over. He's left. I think we're waiting for cookies. Let this drying dish in. The water is filling over. To take a coffee cup. Lost or late? Let's see. We have an ass-eyed tree in the trunk. Like cheese wiping tea towel. Anything more? Nothing. That's fine.
