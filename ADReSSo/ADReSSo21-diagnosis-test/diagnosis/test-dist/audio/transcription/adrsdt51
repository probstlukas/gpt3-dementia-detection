 Here's the picture. How she washing dishes, her wiping dishes, the water's running over the sink. Here's stealing the cookies. He's falling over on the stool. The wind is blowing. Not side to window. The girl is saying be quiet and looking for another cookie. She's like Eve encouraging him to steal off of me. She's standing in a puddle. She's thinking deeply about something and what? She's not going to wash it. That's it.
