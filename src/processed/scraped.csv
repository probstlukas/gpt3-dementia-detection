Maybe she's just the caretaker or the babysitter. Maybe that would give her a reason for being a little disengaged here. But anyway, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. And when she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to the present. Otherwise, it looks like a beautiful day out side. Is there anything else I should say about this picture?",30,cn
130,adrso186,"adrso186.  Tell me everything you see happening in the bath pressure. Everything is going on there. Okay. On the first bite, the mother forgot to turn off the water and the water is running out that sink. And she's standing there, going on the floor. The child has got a stool and reaching up to the cookie jar and the stool is tipping over and he sort of put down the tights and she's reaching up to get up. I don't see anything wrong with that. Okay. Yes, that's it. I can't find it.",26,cn
131,adrso276,"adrso276.  Oh, it's the same picture. It should give you a different one. They're afraid too. Why? It could be more fun if you had some blood. That's great for it. Okay. We have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the scene and her two children. And the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking at the window that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar and as he's getting up there, the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over. And the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie jar, the covered door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie. It looks as though he is to a sister and grab another one for himself. But I doubt he's going to get all that done before the stool falls over. The other around the corner of the kitchen, there's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are covered below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are. Then when you get over a hand of turn to corner in the kitchen, you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look so summer outside because the window is open. There are things growing out there. There's a walk, there's some shrubbery underneath another window that looks in another wing of the house. There's a tree beyond. There are tie-back curtains to the window. The mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and apparently there's no overflow in the sink. So it's overflowing right onto the floor, splice splice. And she has on a sleeveless dress, which also indicates that it's summer out. It looks like she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drawing a dish with a tea towel, a plate with a tea towel. Besides the sink, there are two cups and a plate. There are some seds and some dishes in the sink. And two faucets with X-type handles, one on either side and the center faucet. She has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip on shoes. There's a little scallop balance across the top of the curtains. I think that's all I'm going to tell you. Well, the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you have to get a hold of to pull the covered door open. And what's really strange is that can't see any handles on the other side of the kitchen.",29,cn
132,adrso183,"adrso183.  What should you tell me? Everything you see happening in that picture. Everything that's going on there. The boy is reaching into the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. The little girl is reaching for a cookie. Mother is drying the dishes. The sink is running over. Mother is getting her feet wet. They all have shoes on. There's a cup, two cups, an assassin on the sink. The window has withdrawn with drawn drapes. You look out on the driveway. There's kitchen cabinets. Tell me what's happening. Oh, what's happening? Mother is looking out the window. The girl is touching her lips. The boy is standing on his right foot. His left foot is sort of up in the air. Mother is right foot is flat on the floor on her left toe. She's holding the dish cloth in her right hand and the plate. She is drying in her left. I think I've run out of it.",30,cn
133,adrso274,"adrso274.  Alright, the boy is taking a cookie out of the cookie jar. He has one of his left hand to reach down to give to a sick well. He has it as a left hand, his sister or her girl is reaching up for a cookie and has her inner index finger right hand pointed upward close to her mouth. And I'm maybe she's saying, I'm going to have to be quiet because the stool is quite a fall over. The boy has his right heel on his left toe, wearing running shoes and pom-poms on them. His lips look pretty sloppy. I observed that one of the two slippers that the girl is wearing looks as if it's so less thicker than the one the left one is thicker than the right. The woman is letting the sink run over. The water is running full tail. It's an overflowing with sink. She's drying and played and she has a towel in her right hand. And looks if she has something else. I know that's the curtain. Hey, the back and the curtain that's behind her. The plate and her left hand. She has her left side to the window. The she's already dried a plate and two cups. The window is open and you can see the path up side going around to the back of the house and another room in the house. The window is also open and bleeding. I don't know. She's standing with the woman standing when they're put in the water. Not where it isn't. The water is running out of her. But it's splashing up and the right shoe is in the water. Cut off. The next one I see is okay. Then a kitchen.",30,cn
134,adrso012,"adrso012.  Well, I see a kitchen and a housewife or a homemaker at the sink and her two kids are having a great time. She is drying a dish as her sink overflows. She must be blind, but that's her doing. Also the kid is about to fall, having unsuccessfully, help successfully, gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who's up on a stool and the daughter is there trying to grab the cookie, I guess, from the boy. What else looks like a nice yard and back with a bit of a garden and some grass. I believe she's standing in the water. It still bothers me that she's going blind, that she can't, well, she'll feel it's on her feet when the water hits her. That's what I see.",29,cn
135,adrso270,"adrso270.  The mother's arm trying to dish and the water's running over. And then the boy is taking cookies out of the cabinet and he's tipping over on the stool and the girl is reaching for one and she has one finger to her mouth. I'm such another one here. I guess and the lady has one foot back at the other and looks like the window's opening. She's already dragged some dishes there when you can't. The cabinet door's open. I'm going to have a floor. Sink is running over. I guess I said that. Okay? That's fine. He's the only one cookie to the other girl. The little softer cookie, Joe. Okay.",30,cn

And the whole thing is going to collapse but aside from that they seem to be a fairly happy family.",29,cn
144,adrso003,"adrso003.  Starting from the left, I see two children standing on a tipping stool, reaching for the cookie jar. The boy is up on the top of the stool, obviously getting the cookies for the little younger sister. Mom is washing the dishes while the sink is overflowing, or doing the dishes.

And she's standing in a bed. Her kiddos at Robbie's, the John the Little Boys, falling off the stools is getting some pretty smell. And her old doesn't have her dish yet.

She's high back. And what pretty do you have to remember is, she's sitting on one of the house, living room, half of the house, and landscaping is bushes of clothes and you know, I think.
