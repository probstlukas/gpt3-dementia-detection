Well, the girl's reaching for a cookie and the boy is on his stool, which is falling over and getting the cookie jar up on the second shelf of the cupboard, the door open, the faucet is running and it's overflowing onto the floor because the overflowing into the sink. The woman is drying a plate. She's also looking out the window. There's a couple of bowls that are played on the counter. Curtains at the windows. There's a driveway or it looks like a driveway outside and you can see another window and some bushes out there and the tree. I guess that's what looks like a part of the garage. The window's a garage out there. The cookie jar has a lid off and the boy has one hand in the cookie jar and one with a cookie in it handing. That's what the little girl has got her hand up for it and it looks like that her finger and a mouse is telling him to be careful. Okay. Good."
7,adrsdt27,"adrsdt27.  I'm going to show you everything that you see happening with everything that's going on in the left. Okay. It was summertime and mother and the children were working in the kitchen. The window was open and there was a slight breeze blowing in. The mother was daydreaming and forgot and left the water and the sink running and it was overflowing. The children were hungry and because they knew mother was distracted doing the dishes, they did something they probably should not have done. They got the kitchen stool loaded under the cupboard where the cookie jar was and the young boy climbed up to get a cookie. Because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool, he's about to fall. I don't know why he remembers it. He's probably hurting himself. His head is going to hit the kitchen covers. It looks like the house is set in the country. It's a large house. Either that or you're seeing another house or a wing of the house. It's grass flowing. A little path. The mother looks pretty laid back there."
8,adrsdt18,"adrsdt18.  What do you see going on in the kitchen? My mother is drying the plate. The water is running on the poro running in the sink.

The little boy has taken the cookies and the little girls, detaining them to our, and that be their eating them too, as I like cookies. As the, my hand is always in the cookie jar and the mother is drying the dishes. The water is running over. Each and she's not paying any, never mind to it, I guess.

And the little girls and he gave something to the little girl and she's eaten some of the cookies. And I guess this is Mama and she's washing the dishes and she dropped a dish.

She's looking out the window. I can't make out anything in particular going on outside. The faucet is turned on, of course, which is causing the sink to overflow. The water is splashing on the floor.

21,adrsdt35,"adrsdt35.  Should you see going on in that bridge? Well, I'm seeing a lot of water that isn't supposed to be where it is. A full sink with more water running down along with the floor. A stool that's going to project somebody into a fall and real fast, getting out of the cookie jar. Disco washing and drying. And, uh, girl trying to say silence so that they won't be caught. Two cups and a plate that probably are dry and then the other plate is being dried. A covered door that's open. That stool though. I don't know what he's going to do with that.

Is that one of the things you want? Anything you find. The kids just about ready to let go and fall on his back and he's here. No, it's not. The kids are going to be quiet. They're all so gay.

And his sister is standing beside him, reaching up for some of the cookies. And the mother is standing right near them, watching dishes and the water is running into the sink, and the sink is flooding over with water. And he wants a scenery description or anything like that. Okay, outside the window where the mother is, there's a walkway like it looks like it's going up to a garage. And also on this kitchen sink area, there's a coffee cup, a scoop up, and a plate. And I did say this stool was still filling."
25,adrsdt50,adrsdt50.  The little girl is saying be quiet because we don't want mother to know we're in a cookie jar. The boy is getting cookies and he's going to have an accident because the store is going to go out quite often. Mother is in dream world somewhere because she's drawing dishes and the water is coming out over the floor. She's standing in the water. Yeah. I dont know.

A little girl is shushing. What did you call out? The boy, evidently, they're feeling. And sneaky. And there is a happening. A bird tends to be movement. It's everything we see, I think. Including identifying things. What happened? The lady is standing in a puddle of water. And the cross is running. And the window is open. And there's a house next door. The curtain just a window. The same kind of curtain is first. And there's a tree in the next yard. It almost looks like it doesn't have a stump. It doesn't start from the ground. It starts to get. There's a drop of the room in the yard. There are two cups on the counter. One plate. That's fine. The stool is frippin. You go up all over. Put it in. It's a three.

And the boy is reaching up for cookies and he is laddered, slipped underneath him. I guess he's going to have an accident. And the little girl, she's waiting for the cookies. And I don't think she's going to get it. But the boy is falling down."

And here she's wiping her dish there. And she's looking at the window. Is that all?"
32,adrsdt67,"adrsdt67.  What do I see in this picture? This reminds me probably of when I was very young. Okay, mom is washing the dishes. I don't know why. She's not looking at the kids who are getting into the cookie jar and the young boy is about, of course, to topple over because the stool's tipping. But why the water is overflowing in the sink? I have no idea. She seems so serene and yet so out of it. Okay. Not paying attention really to what's going on. And that's what I see in that picture. Overlooking a backyard, of course, which is neat. You should always have a window in the kitchen."
33,adrsdt58,"adrsdt58.  Well, the young boy is reaching for a cookie jar. He stood on a stool. He lost his balance. He is about to fall. His sister is not going to get the cookie she was anticipating. The mother was thinking about something else because she let the water overflow and there are two dirty dishes and two cups."
34,adrsdt51,"adrsdt51.  Here's the picture. How she washing dishes, her wiping dishes, the water's running over the sink. Here's stealing the cookies. He's falling over on the stool. The wind is blowing. Not side to window. The girl is saying be quiet and looking for another cookie. She's like Eve encouraging him to steal off of me. She's standing in a puddle. She's thinking deeply about something and what? She's not going to wash it. That's it."
35,adrsdt56,"adrsdt56.  Alright, here is the picture. All of the action you can see there. All of the action? Well, the little boy is going to fall off the stool. He's getting up cookie. Do you want me to go slower? No, you got it. Okay, the little girl is asking for a cookie. She's... The mother is grinding dishes. And the sink is overflowing with water. She's getting water all over the floor. And you see if anything is going on outside here. I can't see anything else as far as action is. Is there more? Okay, so that's fine. Thank you."
36,adrsdt69,"adrsdt69.  Well, I see the sink over the fly, and others doing dishes, showing the boys up on the stool, and the stool's falling out, right in his grave, and cooking, but I don't think it's right. And the girl is reaching out. And the woman is standing in the water. And we put the child there just on the phone. So, I'm going to put the child there just on the phone. So, I'm going to put the child there just on the phone. So, I'm going to put the child there just on the phone."
37,adrsdt12,adrsdt12.  Water is pouring out of the sink and the woman is washing dishes. The child is on a stool falling off as he's reaching for the cookie jar. It was right hand and trying to hand other cookies to a little girl who's reaching up with her left hand to get the cookie. Her right hand looks like she's almost trying to make a signal of silence. The mother doesn't hear it. The mother's feet are in the water as it's pouring on the floor. The window is open. You can see a yard outside. There's a dish and cups on the sink. The curtains are pulled back so you can see at the window the cupboard doors open. They're all fully dressed. They have sort of a nondescript expression on their face. The woman has her mouth open a little bit. We each have her mouth open a little bit. And... That's about it.
38,adrsdt15,adrsdt15.  I see a little boy almost falling on a stool trying to get in the cookie jar with his sister. He's side him looking for hers. Mother's washing the dishes and spilling the water. That's about it. A nice window out to sink.

He's reaching for cookies and the mother has their back to him. She doesn't see them but her. She hasn't paid any attention to her sink. It's running all over the place. Her window is open and there's a nice garden and a garage out back. She's drawing some dishes as an apron on. Her dress is sleepless. That's pretty nice kitchen. Like green nice curtains on it. The jar, cookie jar lid is off. There's a couple cups and she has a couple plates but she better mop up. That's a floor. The little girl has socks and shoes on and she's short gas and long hair, medium long hair. And the boy has his shorts on and my short sleeves start so it must be summer. The trees are in blue my side and the flowers out there."
43,adrsdt4,"adrsdt4.  Okay, all of the action. Okay, I see a boy in the cookie jar. I see he has a little bit of... I see he's standing on his three-legged stool. And he's about to depart from that two-legged stool. There's one cookie in his hand and down to his sister and she's reaching her fort. And I think she's indicating the boy to keep still. So his mother doesn't hear us. I see the mother, you know, I guess she's drawing the dishes. She's not paying attention because she's still. I think the sink run over and the sink run over the fort. She must not be conscious because she's standing there doesn't know it. I think she must... I think she's probably looking at the windows. I take the second one. And I see her neck up. I can barely do she's on the table top. I see the cub boobs. I don't know whether they all have knobs on them or not. Doesn't look like the two-legged boy and the girl are having a cub door. And I see her inside. I see her fur and here's the tree and some strawberry. So it is... Okay. Not it. Okay, good."
44,adrsdt41,"adrsdt41.  Well the boy on the chair is fallen, reaching up for a cookie, hand in one of the girls. The lady is wiping a dish while the water is running on the floor. She's standing in it. Trees outside, long, shrubbery, a window outside that I can see. That's about it there."

Just tell me everything that you see going on. Now, there's the picture. Look down here Mr. Toothi. See, part of the old kitchen. Is that old kitchen in residence? A lady, a mother, a kitchen. And her kitchen. And some wood. And some bows. And some here. Is another one in there sharing that? Play you here forever. Okay. There it is. Have you tried? Hard of that. I think they started to play after Christmas. Yes, you were telling me about that. It's a big trivial pursuit. Just tell me, do you see anything else happening in this picture here? What else do you see happening? What's going on there? Well, it looks like. I had to say this is. You can see it. Oh, I'm going to have to go to the boom. Another upbeat. My wife will be thinking about. What's happening over here, Mr. Toothi? That's like the portion. Let's say, what's the machine? Let me say, I can't. Oh, that's a son of a man with school maybe or something. That's the answer there. What's going on here? Well, it's just as though they. Getting ready to go to school or they're just coming home from school. Okay. What's happening here? Right there is. Same as back there except for down here in the bottom, I think. That's a little. Okay."
47,adrsdt25,"adrsdt25.  Can you see going on in the picture? Well, the little boy went up to get some cookies. The little girl reached enough to give the jar to her brother. The mother was washing dishes and the sink is full of water. And the mother is wiping the dishes. And let's see what else. And the boy is almost fallen off this long thing here. What do you want to call this? A chair. And the water is fallen over on the floor by the mother. And the little girl's hand and the hand and her brother. A cookie is probably cookies or he's hand and her cookies, whatever. Okay."
48,adrsdt22,"adrsdt22.  I'd like you to tell me all the things you see going on in the picture. Okay, the water is running out of the sink overflowing. The mother is doing the dishes. The boy is falling off the stool, stealing the cookies out of the cookie jar. The young lady is holding her hand up ready to receive one of the cookies. There is a cup and a saucer on the sink board. There is the drapes on the kitchen, curtains on the kitchen. The cabinets all around the sink and the top cabinets door is open and the cookie jar is in the cabinet. The boy is up there reaching forward and looks like he's going to fall off of the stool. Outside is a nice garden with the path leading around the house and bushes and shrubs and grass growing around. She has a dish towel in her hand doing drying one of the dishes. She has a hairdo. She's wearing an apron and the kids wearing shoes and the water tripping on the floor. What else do you want to know? One."
49,adrsdt14,"adrsdt14.  Everything you see happening in that picture, everything is going on in that picture. I see the boys stretching out for, I don't know when it's a bowl, a bowl or a cake. And he was standing on a stool. This little sister was reaching her hand and the ladder was beginning to go over. Mother was at the dishwasher and she left as far as..."
50,adrsdt13,"adrsdt13.  Well, there's a little boy on a stool. He's gonna fall shortly. Snitching cookies. Mommy's washing dishes. And the sink is running over. I don't know if there's anything more there or not, but that's what I just said. I see cookie drawer. Okay, that's fun. Snitching cookies. Okay."
51,adrsdt2,"adrsdt2.  Okay. Picture. And tell me everything that you see happening here, everything that you see going on. Well, kids standing on a tilted stool, getting cookies. The water is running out of the sink. The towel has two different shoes on. The cookie jar is not a jar. It's a tin thing, tin dish or whatever. Bye."
52,adrsdt47,"adrsdt47.  Tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Tell me everything that's happening there. Young boy is after the cooking jar. He has a cooking jar open. He's reaching for one from south. He's handing one down to his sister. The three-legged stove is coming down with him. They're nicely dressed kids, but the boy needs a socks pulled up. That's all I see there. Mother, I presume it's mother is at the sink. The water is running over out of the sink. She's drying a dish. She's looking out the window. There are two cups and a dish. I presume that's a dish that her already dry, I guess, and sitting on the side of the sink. Nicely grown. Nice curtains pulled back. That's apparently somewhere outside because the windows open or it looks like shrubs are growing. You can see a window in the other part of the house. I presume that's still their house. There's a driveway bordered with grass. There's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage. I see cabinets around the kitchen. Other cabinets. That's about it."
53,adrsdt5,"adrsdt5.  I'm going to show you a picture and in the pictures some things going on. What you do is just look at the picture and describe to any action you see taking place. Can you see that? The kids are so ipin some cookies there and the stool is upsetting. And the kid, the girls tell me we're quiet so there's a mother over there washing dishes in the sinks over the floor and the windows up and I don't see much more than that. She's drawing dishes. You say action? Right. I thought it cookie jar lips falling."
54,adrsdt40,"adrsdt40.  Well, the kids are trying to get the cookies and the boy is on a stool of some kind, ready to fall off as he hands his sister the cookie. And the mother must be daydreaming or in a fog or something, maybe because the water is running over the sink as she's drying the dish. It looks like it's probably a nice day. Maybe the window might be open. I don't look like a nice house. Looks like they have a sufficient income. You want me to go on?"
55,adrsdt49,"adrsdt49.  Okay, I see that the sink is running over and the lady standing there washing her plate and I see the little ball up on the ladder up on the it's not a ladder. This is stool and he's falling off reaching for a cookie in the cookie jar and the little girl is standing by him holding her hand up reaching for the cookie. Okay, I see that the little girl is standing there washing her plate and she's falling off reaching for the cookie."
56,adrsdt71,"adrsdt71.  But I'd like you to do that. We can go around and find them for you. Okay. What do you want here? Just take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening. Everything that you see going on. Everything what? Everything that you see happening in this picture. Mm-hmm.

He's doing the wrong thing though. He's got a hand out there. He's trying to give us something. He's going to fall off that chair. They'll be picking it up pieces. What else you want? That's all it's going on. So I see."
57,adrsdt53,"adrsdt53.  Let me see going on in a picture. Okay, the kid on the bench who's got his hand in the cookie joint is falling off. The sister once won. His mother is standing in a puddle of water because she didn't turn off the faucet. When she's trying to dry a dish, she ought to dry her feet instead. The windmill was open. The water sink is overflowing. It's obviously summer because the window, as I said, was open. Suppose they leave some trees. Anything else that wants to pick up? You just know anything you can come in. The kid's going to fall off. It's pretty cute. The lid is off the cookie jar. He's got one in his hand. Handing it to a sister. He's sneaking another one. I'm sneaking. The water is still running in the sink. And splashing on the floor."
58,adrsdt54,"adrsdt54.  Tell me everything that you see going on in that picture, everything that you see happening. Well, there's another standing there, are lashing the dishes in the sink as they're overspilling. And the wind is open and outside the wind, there's a walk with curved walk with a garden. And you can see another building there, looks like a garage or something with curtains and grass in the garden. And there are dishes that the two cups and the saucer on the sink. And she's going to feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing. She's also oblivious to the fact that her kids are still in cookies out of the cookie jar. And the kid on the stool is going to fall off the stool. He's standing up there and the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar, handing them to his girl about the same age. The kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine. And the mother is going to get shocked when the heat tumbles and the cookie jar comes down and I think it's about all."
59,adrsdt62,"adrsdt62.  Okay, hang on in the picture. Oh, the poor mother's a doin' dishes. There's a boy on a stool. Cookie jar. Girl down below. Is that all you wanted to know? So I mean, everything that you see going on in the picture. Okay. There's a cookie jar, the little boy's standing on a stool and he's ready to go over. The little girl's standing there. The mother's at the sink doin' dishes. Her water's overflowing. Okay, anything else? That's a lot of it. Okay, good."
60,adrsdt65,"adrsdt65.  I want you to tell me all of the action you see going on in the picture. You have two children and boy is on a stool getting into the cookie jar and the stool is tilting over and is probably going to fall. His mother in the meantime is wiping dishes, looking up but is obviously the kitchen window. As the water on his sink and the sink is overflowing, there are two cups and one plate sitting on the sink. The little girl is laughing at the little boy who is getting into the cookie jar and is falling. Okay, good."
61,adrsdt31,adrsdt31.  This boy is about to fall off of the stool. The mother is washing dishes and the water is spilling over on the kitchen floor. The wind is blowing the curtains that a little girl is laughing in her brother. He's taking a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's it.
62,adrsdt36,"adrsdt36.  The little boy is reaching for a cookie and he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over. His blue sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling. The sink is running over and looking water on the floor while the mother is trying to drive the dishes. The window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze. I mean from outside, water is running in the sink that's why it's overflowing. I also believe that the mother is daydreaming. Possibly working but something. That's it for all that."
63,adrsdt38,"adrsdt38.  Okay, here's the picture. Mother is drying the dishes, but the water is fine now that I'm going to sink under the floor. It's a pretty day outside. A lot of flowers. There are three dishes left to wash. It's standing in the water. It's dangerous. The children are getting into the cookie jar. The boy is up there on the stool. It's almost falling over. He's got one cookie and his hand is getting the little girl. He's getting another one out of the cookie jar. Did you say actions for her? Ah, the little girl is kind of... Looks like she's torn in either to be quiet or she's laughing. So, over that. She flutters like she flutters in either way. Water is splashing onto the floor. It's going to get really bad, and dad."
64,adrsdt64,"adrsdt64.  Here's the picture. Well, the mother's washing the dishes and the water's running out of the sink. Can you see anything else going on in that picture? Yeah, there he's standing on the stool and he's going to fall. Okay. Anything else? That's all. I didn't see it. She wants a cook eating the stools falling over. Okay. Good."
65,adrsdt63,"adrsdt63.  What should we take a look at this picture? I want you to tell me everything that you see happening in that picture. Everything that you see going wrong there. The sink is running over and ladies dry the dishes and the voice calling up on the stool and it's falling and he's going to fall down and he's handing a cookie to a little girl. Covered doors open, he was in after the cookie jar after the cookies. No, no. Okay, that's fine. Thank you."
66,adrsdt55,"adrsdt55.  There it is. He's pictures in a kitchen with a family, a mother and a son and daughter. And the son is up in the cookie jar. The cover door is open. He's getting cookies from the jar. He's standing on a stool which is in the process of toppling over. The little girl is holding on her hand for a cookie and she's also has her finger to her lips, shushing him so he doesn't make any noise. The mother seems to be oblivious to what's going on. She's standing there wiping dish and the tap water is running the sink as well flowing down on the floor and she's standing in a puddle. Look outside and the curtains are open and see what looks like could be a garage or an extension of the house, shrubbery, path, tree. Like that in the kitchen on the counter beside her is another plate and a cream and sugar bowlset. The little boy's shoes, he looks like he has jogging shoes on and glow socks and he's wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt. This dish is wearing what it most is sort of a mini dress, mini skirt with sandals. You know, see the ruffle curtains at the window that are drawn back by draw drapes and the cupboards all have recessed handles. Well, they're not recessed. First glance they're recessed but actually they protrude out from the doors and also copyright 1972. Thank you."
67,adrsdt52,"adrsdt52.  Okay, here's the picture. Girl and boy, and a stool, cookies, cookies to our open closet. Okay. Curtain. What's going on in the picture? What kind of action is there? On the long-coage reaching for the cookies and falling over. He's left. I think we're waiting for cookies. Let this drying dish in. The water is filling over. To take a coffee cup. Lost or late? Let's see. We have an ass-eyed tree in the trunk. Like cheese wiping tea towel. Anything more? Nothing. That's fine."

The mother is washing dishes and not paying attention to what she's doing. The sink is overflowing. It's a nice peaceful sign outside. Fortunately, there's nothing happening out there.

The ladder that he's standing on is beginning to fall. There's a little girl in the house. Looks like mother has something fixed for dinner. I guess it is. That is the dish she's dried. There's water running over the sink. I guess that's about it.
198,adrso031,"adrso031.  Where do you see going on? The board is on the ladder and the ladder is to toe and not a ladder to step still. Maybe it's going up. I don't know what I can see.

I'm not even going to step still. It's just a bit scary. Anything else going on? The water is on the floor. There's probably some water on it that this one is going on. I'm not too sure what it is.

And that's dirty to have in on the floor when they're stealing and he's going to fall down and break them down on his back. And I don't think that his mother would be very, be a nice to do that. They would rather have all you want because the water is all over the floor now and look at that. Get there and get down. Oh, bang, you're down on your back. All right."

Then there's lady that is drawing some dishes. But the only thing she is, she's getting water on the floor. That's she has a problem there. And she has two plates and two cups of water. I want her to have a spring whenever and it gets the boys up at the cookie jar. And she's sister didn't get a cookie from her meal. But he has one in his hand now. He has one in his hand and one in the top of the cookie jar. So she finally got a cookie. If he ever puts his arm down. She purses up and she's still got his right in his hand."
255,adrso223,"adrso223.  Okay, and I want you to tell me everything that you see going on in that picture. Just tell me everything that you see happening here. There's the picture.

257,adrso190,"adrso190.  Here's the patient. Oh boy. We always went up on a cookie jar to get cookie and then he's falling off the jar and his sister is just wondering about it. We'll eat at the bottom. Mom will have a sink that's overrunning with water splashing around to her shoes. She's in the process of drying dishes. Looking out on open window at the same time. Cookie jar, I don't know if I can make a rope here, I'll just find a tour of lips. So, everything that's going to happen. Uh-huh. Looking out the window. Maybe it's, I don't know if it's the breeze blowing the curtains because the curtains look a little weaved. Probably the only one to blind. But the window that's looking a little weaved. So maybe there's slight breeze coming in the kitchen window. Mom is drying the dishes and she forgettness up. Water is overflowing from the seat down to the floor splashing into her shoes. Alright, there are two cups and a plate on the counter to the right of the sink. And, uh, I've always wanted to get rid of fall off of the chair. The sister is reaching out for a cookie. So, what else? The door is open, of course, to get into the cupboard. That's about it."
258,adrso106,"adrso106.  What's going on in the picture? The water is running out of a sink and all of this. The little boy is going up into the cookie jar, but he's on the top of the chair that he's going to fall off since it's tipping over. The water that's also on the floor that's coming out of the sink. And... I'll see here. I think we see a little water in here and that... It goes all the way down into this kitchen floor. There's a little one in the cookie jar, but it steps back on the floor. There's a little one in the cookie jar, but it steps back on the chair or whatever you pull this, the table, not a table. To get to the top of the... ...the door. So it's about on the top. Okay, that's fine."

One is on a stool and the stool is over-turning. The little girl is reaching for cookies from the little boy as the stool turns and falls over. There is a window and bushes and path outside the window and the glimpse of another window and another part of the house where curtains with tiebacks are dishes. There are dish tiles or are dish tiles. Now, maybe there are no windows or one dish tiles. I thought it was a table. I'm going to dish tile. Two cups of plate cabinets. Aperin. Grass and trees.

264,adrso186,"adrso186.  Tell me everything you see happening in the bath pressure. Everything is going on there. Okay. On the first bite, the mother forgot to turn off the water and the water is running out that sink. And she's standing there, going on the floor. The child has got a stool and reaching up to the cookie jar and the stool is tipping over and he sort of put down the tights and she's reaching up to get up. I don't see anything wrong with that. Okay. Yes, that's it. I can't find it."
265,adrso173,"adrso173.  And one of what you do is take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening in this picture. Which is tell me everything that's going on here. Everything, not things that are just bad, right? Right. It's everything that's going on. You're a two little kids, a boy and a girl, honest, boys on a stool, which is falling over, getting cookies out of a jar. The cookies are in the cabinet, and they're lit off. And it's in the kitchen. The mother is washing dishes at the window with a curtain on the window, walk outside with trees and grass, water is running over in the sink onto the floor. The mother is drying a dish and stepping in the water. There's a plate and two cups sitting on the cabinet. The mother has an apron on."
266,adrso180,"adrso180.  Tell me everything you see happening in that picture. Everything that's going on there. I mean right now, I'll tell you. Yeah. The boy is stealing cookies out of the jar and he's on a stool that's falling down and the girl is laughing at him and the mother is washing dishes but she's preoccupied and the water is flowing over the sink. And there's trouble galore. The wind is blowing the curtains. She is not paying any attention to her kids and the boy in addition to stealing, he's trying to give the girl a cookie. And the whole thing is going to collapse but aside from that they seem to be a fairly happy family."
267,adrso312,"adrso312.  What do you see going on in that picture? Oh, I see the sink that's running over. I see the stores tipping over. Oh boy, it's trying to get cookies out. And the girl is reaching to get a cookie. Another is trying to just just win those other things. I see if she's washing, oh she's trying to show that. That's going up. And she's standing in the water. The cupboard door is open. There's a quick job. And then there's the lady who gets the cookies on. There's a carton's on the window. I'm going to simulate grass. I'm going to show her right outside in the house next door. Okay? Get your cabinets. Is that it? I see three people in there, a mother, a little boy in the room. Okay. Let it go."
268,adrso315,adrso315.  Just the action. The girl is reaching for a cookie that the boy is trying to get water while he's They're going too fast while he's falling off the ladder And the mother is washing dishes Trying a plate My lasink is spilling over with water that is overflowing from the spikets. They're still running The water is gushing out The girl is signaling to be quiet not to lift the mother's nose with the boy hitting the cookie for it I Did say as she tried to dish with the girl And the water splashing on the floor
269,adrso267,"adrso267.  going on in the picture. Okay there it is. Yes, kind of. Kids are taking cookies from the cookie jar, mother is doing dishes, sink is overflowing, the window is open, the stool is slipping, the sister is holding up her hand for a cookie, the window is open. Yes, uh, where is the door? I'm just drying the dish. That's it. What about down here? The water is dripping, that's what I meant. I'm in flowing over. I probably messed up."
270,adrso260,"adrso260.  And you can begin right there. Well, the little boy is on a step stool trying to reach the cookie jar and his falling. And the girl is reaching for cookie. He has in his hand. The mama's washing dish and the sink's running over. I just dry in a plate and sink is running over down on the floor. The window is up. And all. Do you want something else? Is there anything else? Well, there's a plate two cups on the counter. Is that enough? That's good. I hope so. Yeah."
271,adrso008,"adrso008.  Well, I see what seems to be a mother or could be a babysitter with two children, a boy and a girl. The kids are after the cookies and the little boy is going to hurt himself really badly. And the mother is not too good to shave either because there's water spilling out of the sink. And it's her feet are going to get wet. She could slip. She could break the dishes. She could really hurt herself. The little girl, I think she's safe enough. So it looks like she's a little worried. It's a beautiful day. Wonders are open. The curtains are... Well, it's not too windy because the curtains seems to be in place. Other than that, it seems a very sweet home. And probably a little few years ago, not right now."
272,adrso268,"adrso268.  Alright, the action I see is a little girl with her finger up to her mouth and one arm is thened up looking up at the boy who's reaching up to the cookie jar with his right hand is reaching for cookie with his left hand he already has it because he almost looks like the girl's trying to reach her cookie and lower the left hand and standing on the stool and tipping over and it's like he's about ready to fall and woman in the sink so she's worship wiping a dish with a rag and an hand holding the dish with the other hand and water's flowing into the sink and over the sink so she's not paying attention to what he wants and just flowing out of the sink and all over the floor and she's decking underwater this rod. So this was action, you are an object, no action either"
273,adrso257,"adrso257.  Just look at the picture and tell me everything that you see. I'm going to get a copy of the cookie jar, then I'm stored, stored, got to pop it. I'll gross that step on somebody here and I'll use a browning tissue, I'll write it for an hour and a half and a half and a half. Clips and it's quite just going to look down on. I'm going to look at the window and see if it's rubbery. Clips sideways from the cookie jar, doors open and I can't. I don't care, just need to notice that. Okay, it's okay, I'm going to go in there. I'm going to just open. That's fine. Okay."
274,adrso261,"adrso261.  A boy, a puppy in his one hand in the sand in the cookie jar, standing on a stool which is tipping over. Little girls that are hand up for one and I don't know what the hand means to the mouth. Because I mean she wants to eat. The kitchen sink is running over, the water running out. It's on the floor of mothers trying to ditch his frowning but not turning off the faucet. Two cups on the counter. Flight. Mother's doing a little on curtain to the windows. The lids falling off the roof is running. The cup is half open. That's it."
275,adrso259,"adrso259.  Okay. Okay. Many, all right. The mother is washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing. She has some of them dried already on the side. She's looking out the window. A little boy is falling off the stool as he's getting into the cookie jar to keep to his little sister who's reaching after they get the cookie also. There's water all over the floor and there's the garden is outside and the mother's not paying any attention to what they do. The stool is tipping. The cookie jar, the door is open. Then the little breeze coming in because this window is open. Then little girl saying, has her finger to her mouth? We won't tell mother, you give me the cookie. It's in the kitchen of course and it cups to cups in the dish already have been dried and the mother's stepping in the water and she's probably so engrossed in what she's doing outside. She neither knows what the children are doing or is she paying any attention to the water's overflowing. Okay. Good. All right."
276,adrso292,"adrso292.  Now let's sit. Joven and Dan Cookies. School's going to fall. The sink is overflowing. Another's washing. They're drawing dishes. The girl is putting her finger up to her mouth. I guess I don't know, they took the lid off of the cookie jar and it out to the door. I'm sorry. Okay."
277,adrso266,"adrso266.  Tell me everything is the hand. I don't know. The girl was watching the boy going to the cookin' jar. The other cookin' was hand. He saw him still. He still was falling. The mother's dry and dishes has a plate in her hand, sink his elbow, falling, just water on him. She's stepping in the water. So that's going on, you see? The little girl looks like she's motioning to the boy we've watched. The woman's looking at the window. Okay."
278,adrso007,"adrso007.  A mother standing by the sink, kind of looks like lost and thought, wiping a dish. The sink is overflowing with water, she doesn't seem too concerned. A boy is on a stool, it's about to tip over, he's in the cookie jar, his sister's got her hand up, reached, waiting for a cookie, and the mother seems oblivious to what they're doing."
279,adrso014,"adrso014.  I see a woman who has zoned out. She's in the world of her own, obviously. She's not aware of what's going on. Her son obviously is caught. Maybe it's not her son. Maybe she's just the caretaker or the babysitter. Maybe that would give her a reason for being a little disengaged here. But anyway, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. And when she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to the present. Otherwise, it looks like a beautiful day out side. Is there anything else I should say about this picture?"
280,adrso022,"adrso022.  And then here on this one, tell me everything you see going on in this picture. Well, I see the mother is not paying attention and her water is running over her sink. The boy has climbed up on a ladder to steal some cookies and he's falling over. The girl is laughing. The grass is growing outside. Nobody sings to care. They're just going home with their daily activities. Could anything else you see? No right or wrong answers, but is there anything else you see going on in the picture? No, not really."
281,adrso281,adrso281.  There's a cookie jar on the shelf. The old boy's up on a store and the store is about to fall. He's about to fall. The store is about to turn. A little girl in pictures reaching from the cookie. Mother is washing dishes that waters running over onto the floor. She has a plate in her hand and a towel. She's crying. Two cups are sitting on the counter. And also a plate. You can see out through the kitchen window to another part of the house. And then draw a walkway away from the house. You can see a window across in the other part of the house. A road. A tree that there are hurt on the way to the house. ... ... ... .. Sorry for being kind. ... Come here with me? ... Come here. You'll cut here.
282,adrso286,"adrso286.  Tell me everything that you see going on in the picture. Just tell me what's happening there. Well, the more things this boy and I and the stew getting cookies, it's stews but for home. And the little girl's reason for some cookies, she got a finger out of my mouth. Mother's dry and dishes and water's running over. She got a, and she's drying dishes, water's running over. She's standing in the water. There's a sink there, plate, cup. Outside, you can see the outside there, the walkway, edges, and one of the trees. I started to cook and cook a job. We'd have to get a cup. And there's a, what's he called, the kind of rye on in the kitchen. That's in curtains. No wonder. Stop judgmenting."
283,adrso023,"adrso023.  Tell me everything you see going on in this picture. This one? Yes, ma'am. Oh, a little boy, six and a half, a stool, trying to get a cookie for his sister, I guess. And then the mother's washing dish and her sink is running up. Okay. Hello. And she's washing dishes and drying. Can you see anything else going on? I mean, there are no right-or-one answers. I just want to be straight away. No. No, just the water, just going in the floor and going, you're always fixing a fog. Trying to get the cookies. They'd see anything going outside. Yeah. Great. Thank you very much."
284,adrso012,"adrso012.  Well, I see a kitchen and a housewife or a homemaker at the sink and her two kids are having a great time. She is drying a dish as her sink overflows. She must be blind, but that's her doing. Also the kid is about to fall, having unsuccessfully, help successfully, gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who's up on a stool and the daughter is there trying to grab the cookie, I guess, from the boy. What else looks like a nice yard and back with a bit of a garden and some grass. I believe she's standing in the water. It still bothers me that she's going blind, that she can't, well, she'll feel it's on her feet when the water hits her. That's what I see."
285,adrso015,"adrso015.  Okay. I'm going to show you some pictures. Okay? Here's a picture. Tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Okay mom, it's washing dishes with the sink, it's running over with water. I'm always trying to get cookies and I'm still a little bit swollen and the sister doesn't hear about the steps she had fallen. She wants the cookies. And then she's got the window open, those like which is very unusual. And they're um dishes on the camera. Is that it? All right. You're talking about action stuff. Um anything like overall picture, anything that you see happening. Is that a big picture? They're close to one of the best part of their house or if there is that next door neighbor. It could be you know a walk to the lodge or it could be a mystery."
286,adrso273,"adrso273.  There's the two children are in the process of stealing cookies from the cookie jar. And the little girl has her finger up to her mouth to be quiet and the stool on which the boy is standing is about to fall. And the mother must be looking at the window because the sink is spilling over with water, overflowing with water. And meanwhile she's drying the dishes and the water is falling down onto the floor. It's a nice day. The window is up, but it looks like it's a nice day outside. It's about all I can see on there."
287,adrso280,"adrso280.  There's the picture. This little boy has a cookie jar. He has got no one on his stool, which is tipping over. And just to stand there, wanting some cookie too. Oh, yeah. And all of this is behind another's back. She's washing dishes. Water is running over. She must be daydreaming. The water is running over onto the floor. She has a thing to notice it. And there are a couple of dishes there. She must be drying the dishes. They look dried on the counter. The one in your hand, I thought she just taken out. And then back, there she's yard. And then on the sidewalk. And then another wing of the house, or the window. And then she's cutting it. And then there's another thing. Which is a nice big, bright, red little rock farm. I think there are other plants. Oh, yeah. She said, coming in. Okay, I meant that. You did fine. That's great."
288,adrso274,"adrso274.  Alright, the boy is taking a cookie out of the cookie jar. He has one of his left hand to reach down to give to a sick well. He has it as a left hand, his sister or her girl is reaching up for a cookie and has her inner index finger right hand pointed upward close to her mouth. And I'm maybe she's saying, I'm going to have to be quiet because the stool is quite a fall over. The boy has his right heel on his left toe, wearing running shoes and pom-poms on them. His lips look pretty sloppy. I observed that one of the two slippers that the girl is wearing looks as if it's so less thicker than the one the left one is thicker than the right. The woman is letting the sink run over. The water is running full tail. It's an overflowing with sink. She's drying and played and she has a towel in her right hand. And looks if she has something else. I know that's the curtain. Hey, the back and the curtain that's behind her. The plate and her left hand. She has her left side to the window. The she's already dried a plate and two cups. The window is open and you can see the path up side going around to the back of the house and another room in the house. The window is also open and bleeding. I don't know. She's standing with the woman standing when they're put in the water. Not where it isn't. The water is running out of her. But it's splashing up and the right shoe is in the water. Cut off. The next one I see is okay. Then a kitchen."

290,adrso308,adrso308.  It's a kitchen scene and the mother is doing the dishes. The children are trying to get into the cookie jar. The stool is falling over. The water is running over in the sink. The window is open and there is grass. The grass and trees on the side are building a little. The little girl is asking the boy for a cookie. The mother is drying the dishes. The water is standing in the water. The little boy is asking for a cookie and the stool looks as though it's going to fall over.
291,adrso167,"adrso167.  I'd like you to do is just look at the picture and tell me anything at all that you see going on. Children are getting into the cookie jar, the little boy who's on the stew is about to fall because the stew is going to topple over. The mother has her back turned and is drawing the dishes. The sink is full of water and the water is beginning to spill over onto the floor. The sink is in front of a window. One can look out the window and see a path. What is obviously a yard. There's a plate and two cups or dishes on the counter. The children getting into the cookie jar, there's one boy and one girl. The cookie jar is labeled cookie jar. The cover door is open. There are curtains at the kitchen window. The mother is wearing an apron. She has to sleep this dress in short hair. The little girl has straps on her shoes. The stew is a three-legged stew. That's about it."
292,adrso158,"adrso158.  So now, yeah. The boy reaching on his own stool, reaching for cookies, and the stool is ready to follow him. He's got one hand, he's going to cook the jaw, and he's got a cookie and a left hand. And he's got a girl standing beside him. And she's reaching for the cookie that he had in his hand, and she has her right finger up in her lip. There's a woman, there's a lot of others standing at the same time, drying dishes, and we think that he's going to throw water onto the floor. You just let the action. Like that. Awesome. And water is coming out of the closet. Okay. Great. Thank you."
293,adrso160,"adrso160.  The first thing we're going to do is take a look at that picture and tell me everything you see happening. Everything is going wrong. Well, the water is running over on the floor. The chair is tilting. The boy is into the cookie jar. And his sister is reaching for a cookie. And mother is drawing dishes. Do you want to action or just want anything I see? Just that. Okay. Okay, thanks very much."
294,adrso156,"adrso156.  Just everything that you see happening. Oh, wow. Well, the money must be daydreaming because the water's overflowing in the sink. And the window's open. She's drawing a dish. The boys in the cookie jar giving his going in the cookie jar giving his sister a spare to fall off the stool. And the sister goes on the little girl who's sister and not but the little girl has her finger to her mouth and she's trying to, um, trying to get him to be quiet. As I just garage her house next door. I"
295,adrso169,"adrso169.  There's a kid stealing cookies from the cookie jar. Stools about to topple over. The sisters asking for one. Cookie jar is open, of course. It covers open. Mother's dry and dishes. The sink is overflowing. There are some dishes on the sideboard. Windows open. I know what else you want. There are curtains in the window. There's windows."
296,adrso151,"adrso151.  Okay, here's the picture. All of the action you see going on. Boy, taking cookies out of the cookie jar, the stool is falling. A little girl is reaching. Water is running out of the closet. Water is overflowing the sink. Woman is pushing dishes. Dry dishes. Okay, good. It's fine."
297,adrso300,"adrso300.  I'm doing a child each and for a cookie. It's your third. You're all off the way moving there. I'm going to put them on the region for a cookie. Water is running out of the sink. And the matter is dry in dishes. I'm going to put these cream on the cute past. As I exhale, I run the spine in the water. So I'm going to put them on the ocean."
298,adrso307,"adrso307.  down in the picture. The boys, the girls make a fun of the boys. You may find them so much while he was still on the cookie out of the cookie jar. And it made him trip. And he's going to follow the mothers listening to the kids. She's trying dishes. She's got the window. It's an ear. She's paying attention to sink to sink. Spill water onto the floor. It's getting her feet wet. The curtains are open to allow first year to come in the house. There's two cups on that's the addition of sink. And the faucets are open and the cupboard doors open. Looks like it might be sour spring or summer or I'd be just sitting like that could grow on it. I'd say she has shoes on. She has shoes on. He has shoes on. She has shoes on. She has dress, dress, apron, shirt, shorts, socks, socks. And lids up to cookie jar. There's a fancy sink cabinet over here. And a fancy wall cabinet over there. That's about it."
299,adrso309,"adrso309.  I mean, picture. Tell me everything is going on in there. Mother is drying the dishes, looking out the window and not paying attention to the water, spilling all over the floor in the sink. The window is open. The children are behind mother, stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. The boy is climbed up on the store which is tipping over. He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, handing them to his sister. His shoes are untied. He's going to fall. The cupboard door is open. The lid's off the cookie jar. Mother's feet are getting wet. She must be in our space and she doesn't notice all this."
300,adrso157,"adrso157.  Okay, and there's the picture. Oh, yes. Just go ahead and tell you the mother is drying a plate. The water's sink is clogged and there's more water going over it and it's splashing onto the floor. And the voice falling off the stool getting hooked us from the puppy jar. And the girls put their finger up to her left, which means I won't tell her something like that. Shoes are getting wet in the mother. Looking outside, we're going to see a building and a snowing. I don't know if it's a water spill in the boy falling off the stool. Okay. I don't know if that snow is action. I don't get snowing. It's a plate out there."
301,adrso168,"adrso168.  Tell me everything that you see happening with that creature. Everything you see going on. Alright, boy is getting into the cookie jar. He's got one on his hand, but the stool is falling over as he's reaching for the cookies. The girl is laughing at him. Mother is standing by the kitchen sink, drying dishes. The water is on and the sink is spilling over. There is a window over the sink which shows a yard, curtains. There are two cups and a plate on the sink. There is a set of kitchen cabinets. The mother has on an apron and she sees the stress. The girl has on a dresser, a skirt and a blouse. Boy looks like he's got on short trousers and a shirt with a sweater. Cookie jars, full of cookies, the lid is off. That's it."
302,adrso161,"adrso161.  Well, this little boy is up on his stool, taking cookies, handing him down to the sister, and she's telling him to be quiet, and the stool is tipping over. The mother is washing her drying dishes. The water is running into the sink, and running over down onto the floor. The wind must be blowing because the curtains look like they're... ...put your door, that cabinet door is open. Mother's standing in water. That's it."
303,adrso159,"adrso159.  So, the action that you see going on in that picture. Anything that I want. Okay, the boys reaching cookies and the stool is falling over. The girl is reaching for her brother to give her a cookie. Another is doing dishes, but the water is throwing over on the floor. The wind is open. Dance. Did you just want to action or just? No, I'm just kidding."
304,adrso310,"adrso310.  I just want you to tell me what you see going on in that picture. The water is running over. The stew was, the boy's going to fall off the stool. The girl is saying, give me one or I will tell. And the boy's taking the second out of the cookie jar. The lid's going to fall off. The mother's drying the dishes. The window is open. She's standing in the water. She's drying the dishes. Anything else? Wait, what's in the picture? What's going on? What's going on? That's what's going to be action."
305,adrso178,adrso178.  But I want you to do to look at this picture and tell me everything that you see going all the way. Everything that you see happening in that picture. Are you getting now? Yeah. Boy is getting reaching for cookies. The stool is falling over. The sister is reaching for cookies. The woman's wiping the dishes. The sink is running over. The boys stepping on one of his own toes. They're all going to be quiet. Don't let mommy see. That's everything. That's about it.
306,adrso182,"adrso182.  I'd like for you to take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening in there, everything that's going on. You know, it sinks over, Floyd. And the stream's tipping over with the boy on it. He's taken out a cookie, he has one this hand, he's got a hand of the girl. And everything else looks like it's fixed. The woman's wife and the dishes, three dishes setting on the counter. The cover door's open, of course, or he couldn't get the cookies. The little girl's pointing to her mouth. And I think I mentioned that the boy has one cookie in his left hand and just grabbing one with his right hand."
307,adrso316,"adrso316.  Sir, I'd like to tell you everything that you see going on in the picture. And that's the picture. Action type things. There is water coming out of a faucet into a basin which is overflowing onto the floor. Mother is drying dishes and she's walking in the water that is flowing on the floor. Two children are stealing cookies. One of them is up on a stool that is about to fall. These are removing cookies from an upper shelf in the closet. The wind appears to be blowing because the curtains appear to be puffed. Those are the only action things that I can see."
308,adrso148,"adrso148.  I wish you make us laugh. Are you ready? Well, the sink is overflowing. Let it was standing in the water like a jerk. She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk. The boy is trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar, but boy, he's about to fall off the stool. His sister has her hand up her finger up to her mouth, like she's saying, shh, to be quiet, tell her mother what you're doing. And he's about to hand her a cookie, but in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe. Mother, the reason the water's flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously. And I'm looking out through the window, and I don't see anything going on out there. That's just a bush I'm presuming, or plum pudding. I told you the stool is about to go over. I don't know what this is going to be, okay, I'll switch, which will make what's going on in the picture. It'll look like nothing. The cookie jar is full, the lid is off the cookie jar. Do you want me to tell you all those things? Tell me all the things you see going on in the picture. The cabinet door has just swung open. It stills about to fall. I guess I've told you that, but the terrible crash. Mother is daydreamy. She doesn't even know what's going on behind her. I think that's very important and sometimes typical. Seems to. Okay, that's fine."
309,adrso177,"adrso177.  I want you to tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Everything that you see happening here. Go ahead. Well, for one thing, the boy is stealing cookies. And the girl is asking for cookie. And the boy is standing on a stool, which is tipping over. And the lady is drying her plate. And the water is running in the sink and overflowing on the floor and getting her feedback. And the window is open. And I don't know if there's anything special going on outside the window. It seems to me that that's essentially the things that are going on in this picture. And the girl is picking her nose. The boy is handing her a cookie. Really those are the only activities I see. Okay."
310,adrso183,"adrso183.  What should you tell me? Everything you see happening in that picture. Everything that's going on there. The boy is reaching into the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. The little girl is reaching for a cookie. Mother is drying the dishes. The sink is running over. Mother is getting her feet wet. They all have shoes on. There's a cup, two cups, an assassin on the sink. The window has withdrawn with drawn drapes. You look out on the driveway. There's kitchen cabinets. Tell me what's happening. Oh, what's happening? Mother is looking out the window. The girl is touching her lips. The boy is standing on his right foot. His left foot is sort of up in the air. Mother is right foot is flat on the floor on her left toe. She's holding the dish cloth in her right hand and the plate. She is drying in her left. I think I've run out of it."
311,adrso170,"adrso170.  I'll just take a lot of this picture and tell me everything you see is going on. Okay, the boy is standing up the time to get to the door and the stool is falling. The girl is reaching up to get a cookie out of his hand. The mother is at the window washing dishes. The sink is overflowing, getting on the shoes. The sausage is floating on the... But you don't know what's going on. You want to tell you what's on the sink, too, everything? Oh, well, that's all I see happening. Plus, some point."
312,adrso002,"adrso002.  Okay, I see a mom doing the dishes and the water's overflowing from the sink and she seems to be completely oblivious of it. The children in the picture who I presume are hers are climbing, one, the boy is climbing on a, or standing on a stool that's about to fall over, putting his hand in the cookie jar on the top shelf and his sister or cousin or whoever the girl is, is reaching up for cookie. The window is open, there's a pathway with garden on either side, it looks like there's something else on the sink. I mean on the countertop dishes. And that's the mother who has an apron on. She is dressed in the Mrs. Beaver style with a very, with an apron and a nice dress and shoes and so forth. And I don't understand why she's not turning the water off, but that's part of the deal and there's curtains on the window and there's pains in the window, small pains. That's about it."
313,adrso005,"adrso005.  Oh my, I'm such a mess that I think is overflowing. And I don't know why she's not even carrying. She meaning the wife or mother, while the kids are, one of the kids is falling off the stool. Big, accident momentarily. It's possibly she's looking out of the window. She doesn't look, she looks unhappy. She's got a frown on her face. And walking in the puddle of water that's coming out of the sink, that's really, no, it doesn't look like a terribly organized way of life here in this kitchen. Of course the boy is going to fall on the ground and crash with some of the cookies will also come out onto the ground. Well, that's something going on outside. Nothing serious though. Just the rest of the house. And the sidewalk. That's about all."
314,adrso263,"adrso263.  Okay, there's the fixer. Everything is there. You can miss hats or whatever. Yeah. Uh-huh. You want me to start with any particular items? What? We can start now. Well, top left, cookie bean, or noodles from the cookie jar. Hand in cookie to sister. Bought up and on the three-legged stool. Mother drying dishes sink overflowing onto the floor. Uh-huh. You want action types? Yeah. Dry and said drying dishes sink. Water or floating sink. Mm-hmm. You can't have a lot to do with it. Okay, good. Yeah, actually. Okay. Okay. Okay."
315,adrso264,"adrso264.  And there's the picture. So yeah. Do I get to describe that everything? Yeah, I tell you that. Yeah, you can just, you know. Okay. What's going on? Well, the boy is getting cookies from a cookie jar. We're all treating up their hands to receive money. And the boy's in danger of falling because the story's on. It's building. That would be on the phone. The mother is drawing the dishes. And the water is running over, filling on the floor. Stepping in the water. He's looking out the windows that are paying attention to the dishes. Okay."
316,adrso299,"adrso299.  Why don't you take a look at this picture? And I want you to tell me everything that's happening there. Everything that's going well in that picture. Okay, is there a number of things? I mean, do I have to come up with a certain amount? No, just whatever you see happening there. Okay, number one, the blue is still in some copies and he's falling over from the chair. That's not setting straight. And the sinkers are refloing. We want to know everything that's wrong with the picture. Everything that's happening. Everything that's happening. It looks like it's a nice summer day outside. And the lady's drying the dishes. And everything that's happening. She's standing in the water. Really fat in there. The girl seems to be going. Looks like the mother is a little peered. And... I don't think it's him. Okay, fine. Thank you very much."
317,adrso003,"adrso003.  Starting from the left, I see two children standing on a tipping stool, reaching for the cookie jar. The boy is up on the top of the stool, obviously getting the cookies for the little younger sister. Mom is washing the dishes while the sink is overflowing, or doing the dishes. And I'm not really sure what's going on out there, out on the other side of the window. So there's some dishes there on the sink that remain to be done."
318,adrso298,"adrso298.  A little girl is reaching for her brother to give her a cookie. The stool is falling over. The boy has taken the lid off the cookie jar, has a cookie in his left hand, is reaching with his right hand for one. The mother is drying the dishes. The water is flowing, running and flowing out of the sink. The mother is frowning. There's nothing left side. This is bushes. The door is open. The girl looks like she's laughing. Can I stand in the water? Okay. I'll get in. That's nice."
319,adrso291,"adrso291.  What I'd like you to do here is take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening. Everything that you see going on. Do I start? Mm-hmm. The children are getting into the cookie jar which is on the high above the sink. They have the lid off the cookie jar. The boy has two in his hand and the girl is reaching up for them and the stool in which he stands about to upset the door is open and to get the cookie jar, the mother presently is at the sink washing dishes and the sink is running over the water splashing down on the floor. There are two, I suppose dry dishes on the sink. She has one in her hand, a pike, she is drying, she has it on the apron. She is then by the sink is below a window with a path out into a garden. There are shrubbery to the left of the path and you can see beyond that another window and I don't know what that is, there are flowers or weeds. This is part of the house you can see the roof of maybe all the house in the curtains."
320,adrso265,"adrso265.  Let me just look at the picture and tell her to make galore. Okay? This is going to be like looking at those artistic things and suddenly when we get there, we can get her dishwashers. And her dish sink is overflowing on the floor because the faucet is running. And she's standing in a bed. Her kiddos at Robbie's, the John the Little Boys, falling off the stools is getting some pretty smell. And her old doesn't have her dish yet. I don't think the perspective on her corner is quite right over the rim. When her new dishes were picked up and a plate on the counter, and she's drying a plate and her house curtains are moving. She's high back. And what pretty do you have to remember is, she's sitting on one of the house, living room, half of the house, and landscaping is bushes of clothes and you know, I think. And everything is just that. Up five, there's grass in the van, and there's a tree in there. I think it is. Okay. Could you repeat what you saw over there? Yeah, I didn't get it out. You can get in a cup of that. And she's falling off the stool and she's got two cookies already, and she's getting one of his sister, and it's going to have one. Even if you fall, it's going to have this cookies. She has her finger up turned off. I don't know what she's saying. She's sure that I don't want one too. And I'm going to have a mother to be so unaware. Okay, that's sorry. Thank you."
321,adrso262,"adrso262.  Okay, you can start then. Okay, the mother is wiping a dish at the sink. The water is overflowing from the sink. A youngster is about to fall off a stool reaching for a cookie jar. And the little girl is holding up her hand to grab a cookie out of his hand. The window appears to be open, but I can't make out any action in the background there. That's all. Okay, that's fine."
322,adrso296,"adrso296.  Ah, the sinks running over. Water's coming all over the floor. Here, the boy, the step ladders, turn and under his legs, and he's stealing cookies, oh, the cookie jar. And she's begging for cookies to grow. Coming back to the sink, let's see here. Oh, mama's stepping in the water. I said the sink was running over. She's dry and dishes. There's something that I don't know what it is written on my grass, it seems. And I've noticed that I don't know. And that's a tea, tea, and something. I don't know. I don't see anything else there. She's stepping in the water. The sink was running over. That's bell-sucking down there, but I can't see it. Oh, my baby, that's so important. And he's on a stool that's going to fall over, all they're stealing, cookie. There's a plate and two cups on the sink, and she's got a plate in her hand. I don't see anything. Okay."
323,adrso278,"adrso278.  Any action or anything you see? Oh, well, the same server flowing, the lady's washing dishes. The boy's up on the stool, the stool's, he's falling, he's getting cookies out of the cooking. The guy that grows reaching out for the cookies. The wind is open. The door is open, but I can't remember about it."
324,adrso285,"adrso285.  Touching lip, raising arm, zappetune, the end time for cookie, handing cookie down, slipping from stool, stool falling over, and lighting dishes, water running, water overflowing, breathing. tapping out from water. Introducing pleasure. Hi clutter 있는데! Good!"
325,adrso276,"adrso276.  Oh, it's the same picture. It should give you a different one. They're afraid too. Why? It could be more fun if you had some blood. That's great for it. Okay. We have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the scene and her two children. And the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking at the window that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar and as he's getting up there, the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over. And the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie jar, the covered door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie. It looks as though he is to a sister and grab another one for himself. But I doubt he's going to get all that done before the stool falls over. The other around the corner of the kitchen, there's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are covered below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are. Then when you get over a hand of turn to corner in the kitchen, you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look so summer outside because the window is open. There are things growing out there. There's a walk, there's some shrubbery underneath another window that looks in another wing of the house. There's a tree beyond. There are tie-back curtains to the window. The mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and apparently there's no overflow in the sink. So it's overflowing right onto the floor, splice splice. And she has on a sleeveless dress, which also indicates that it's summer out. It looks like she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drawing a dish with a tea towel, a plate with a tea towel. Besides the sink, there are two cups and a plate. There are some seds and some dishes in the sink. And two faucets with X-type handles, one on either side and the center faucet. She has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip on shoes. There's a little scallop balance across the top of the curtains. I think that's all I'm going to tell you. Well, the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you have to get a hold of to pull the covered door open. And what's really strange is that can't see any handles on the other side of the kitchen."
326,adrso010,"adrso010.  Well, let's see, our mama appears to be busy doing the dishes. Wow, she's had a problem. The sink is running over. Meanwhile, why is she distracted? The sun and daughter are off into the cookie jar. And whores, he's about to fall."
327,adrso017,"adrso017.  All right, we have a few more tasks to go through before we break for today. Okay. So, here's a picture. Just tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Well, there's a guy up on the tree and the dog is barking at the guy. Oh, I'm sorry. I give you the wrong one. That was my fault. That was my fault. Okay. All right. Yeah, so that was my own picture. I see a boy robbing the cookie jar and is apparently his sister wanting a cookie, but he's about to have an accident in the process of robbing the cookie jar. And I see the mother walking washing dishes and the sink overflowing because she has the water on in the sink is full. And she must have the stapper in place. She maybe in danger of slipping since there's water on the floor. And the boys that looks like, I think I said that already. I think the boys about to have an accident. So, okay. Okay. Okay."
328,adrso021,"adrso021.  Everything you see going on in this picture. Ground safety hazards as it referred to as a military. The kid on the stool, it's about to fall. And the woman sitting there, blaze, blaze, while her sink runs over on the floor. Let's see the little girl. But she asking for a cookie while her brothers falling down the stool. That's about it. Two accidents were happening in the middle of two accidents happening here. She's standing in water so it's going to be slippery. So she's able to massage the water running over the sink. It's kind of funny the way that sinks drawn, the way it looks like it's all splashing over the front. I don't really see anything else in the picture of significance. Am I supposed to see something else in the picture of significance? No, those hidden things. I wear the faces in the corner. Looks like the typical console sketch of domestic scene where everything goes wrong."
329,adrso019,"adrso019.  Okay little boy is on a stool that he looks like he's going to fall. He's going to the cookie jar and the stool looks like he's going to fall over because it's like bending a little girl is pointing and he's handing her a cookie. And mom is drying the dishes and all the water is coming out of the sink overflowing and she's not paying attention to that. She's looking straight and she's up looking at what she's doing. And there's a cabinet in that room and there's a plate and two cups and you can look outside the window, you see a walkway, you see grass, you see another window with a curtain and in the window there's a room that she's been and has a curtain and there's a window. And I think that's it."
330,adrso283,"adrso283.  There's a picture. Doesn't matter where you start, you know. Alright, there's a little boy on a step stone which is tilted. He's getting some cookies. Now do one descriptive as far as the he lived or how they are or just the action. Just the action. Okay, and looks like he's trying to hand a cookie to his sister. She kind of has her finger up towards her mouth. Like she might be giggling. The mother's drying dishes but the water is overflowing onto the floor. I'm going to soak the sink looks like it's almost tilted. Now we should call the saw, the cup of the saucer is that not action right? The breeze might be blowing. The curtains might be blowing. I'm going to go ahead and see if I can see the other side. I'm going to go ahead and see if I can see the other side."
331,adrso277,"adrso277.  Don't do so in your research. They have a lot of action going on. What I need you to do is tell me all of the action used to be going on in the research. Okay? And use the things. Tell me all of the action. Okay. Okay. Okay. Can we all be action? No, but I'm sure why? Why? Okay. Why is the boy is on a stool? Then cook it from cookie jar. Give him to the girl with the stool to buy bread and chipmunks. And the mother is drying in the research and she's in a scent bottle. That's food to scent more and it's dry and you're going to the floor. Okay. That's all the action. I'm sure."
332,adrso270,"adrso270.  The mother's arm trying to dish and the water's running over. And then the boy is taking cookies out of the cabinet and he's tipping over on the stool and the girl is reaching for one and she has one finger to her mouth. I'm such another one here. I guess and the lady has one foot back at the other and looks like the window's opening. She's already dragged some dishes there when you can't. The cabinet door's open. I'm going to have a floor. Sink is running over. I guess I said that. Okay? That's fine. He's the only one cookie to the other girl. The little softer cookie, Joe. Okay."
333,adrso018,"adrso018.

And there's a nice window. But I don't see anything much else going on. Right. Thank you."
335,adrso164,"adrso164.  What do you see going on? I see a little boy on the school and he's just falling over taking cookie-side of the cookie jar. And the little girl is putting her finger to her mouth to keep it quiet. The mother is washing dishes. She's drying the dishes and letting the water keep on running in the sink and the water is running over and she's standing in the sink and the water that's running over. There's a window there and she's looking out at the grass on the flowers. The curtains seem to be shaking from the wind, and the air that's blowing in. The dishes that she's through drying are sitting on the sink top. The little girls raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie. And he has one cookie and his hand and he's going after another one. It's ready to hand her a cookie. Another is holding a dishcloth that she's drying the dishes with. I'm seeing the other action.
